## TreasureMaze Q-Learning Agent
**Course:** CS-370 — Current & Emerging Trends in Computer Science  
**Tech:** Python, Q-learning, epsilon-greedy<br>
**Code:** 
<a href="projects/cs370-dqn/Murray_Orion_ProjectTwo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  Treasure Hunt Game Notebook
</a>

**What I built**
- Implemented the **Q-training algorithm** that learns from agent–environment interactions
- Added **epsilon-greedy** to balance exploration vs. exploitation
- Integrated with provided environment classes (**TreasureMaze**, **GameExperience**) that handled maze mechanics and experience storage

**Why it matters**
- Demonstrates practical **reinforcement learning**: algorithm design, policy control, and integrating with an existing environment

- **What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**<br>
  In this project I was provided with foundational code that included the environment setup being the maze structure for the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes. These classes handled the basic mechanics of the game environment such as how the agent interacts with the maze and how experiences are stored for later use. I provided the code responsible for the Q-training algorithm that defined how the agent learned from its interactions with the environment and updating it's memory. I also integrated the epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation so the agent could learn how to navigate the maze to find the treasure.<br>

- **What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**<br>
  Computer scientists are problem solvers who use computational methods to find efficient solutions to complex problems. This involves not just coding but also understanding the underlying principles of computation, data management, and software design. It matters because they drive innovation by developing new algorithms, software, and technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible in fields like in this case artificial intelligence.

- **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**<br>
  When approaching a problem as a computer scientist I try to follow a systematic process to ensure that the solution is both effective and efficient. This consists of understaning the clients requirements, planning out the design of the project, and then implementing a iterative product that has been throughly tested. If any feedback is given i try to go back and incorporate those changes.

- **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**<br>
  My ethical responsibilties to end users and the orginization would be to use secure and transparent methods for processing data. If data isn’t handled responsibly, either the company itself could exploit its customers, or a bad actor could cause a breach. To address this, I would advocate for complete transparency with users about their data, provide an easy and effective way for them to opt out of data usage, and employ robust security measures to store and encrypt user information.
