# Selected Class Projects

## TreasureMaze Q-Learning Agent
**Course:** CS-370 — Current & Emerging Trends in Computer Science  
**Tech:** Python, Q-learning, epsilon-greedy • **Code:** Private (available on request)

**What I built**
- Implemented the **Q-training algorithm** that learns from agent–environment interactions
- Added **epsilon-greedy** to balance exploration vs. exploitation
- Integrated with provided environment classes (**TreasureMaze**, **GameExperience**) that handled maze mechanics and experience storage

**Why it matters**
- Demonstrates practical **reinforcement learning**: algorithm design, policy control, and integrating with an existing environment

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists solve complex problems using computational methods—algorithms, data, and software design. That work advances what’s possible across fields, including AI (as in this project).

**How I approach problems**  
Understand requirements → plan the design → implement iteratively → test thoroughly → incorporate feedback.

**Ethical responsibilities**  
Use secure, transparent data practices. Be clear with users about data usage and opt-outs, and employ strong storage/encryption to reduce misuse or breach risk.
